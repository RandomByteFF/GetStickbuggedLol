## Functions
Pulling your finger across the screen draws a line. After the line has reached the minimum width it detatches. After 9 lines has been drawn the lines automatically arrange into a stickbug, then plays the "Get stick bugged lol" video on a loop, until the user presses the reset button, which is indicated by a "Fuck go back" png

## TODO
*   Fix lines being longer then the required line width
*   Disable sounds button
*   (Optional) Custom video

## Setup
Just download the apk from the builds folder, then install it on an android phone

## Inspiration
Couldn't sleep, meme was trending, should I say more?
